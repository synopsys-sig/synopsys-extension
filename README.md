**NOTE:** This extension has been deprecated and will not work after February 14, 2025. It is recommended that you migrate to our new <a href="">Black Duck Security Scan</a>. Instructions can be found <a href="<community url>">here</a>

Synopsys Security Scan Extension for Azure DevOps enables you to configure your Azure pipeline to run Synopsys security testing and take action on the results.
Synopsys Security Scan leverages Synopsys Bridge, allowing you to run tests for several Synopsys products from the command line.

To use Synopsys Security Scan, please follow the steps below:

1. Configure Azure DevOps as described in the [Azure Prerequisites](https://sig-product-docs.synopsys.com/bundle/bridge/page/documentation/c_azure-prerequisites.html) page.
2. Install and configure Synopsys Security Scan for the Synopsys product you are using. <br/>
